# Apogee

Project Apogee is a multiplayer procedural space sandbox game with a focus on
complex interconnected simulation systems. At the core of the experience is an
emulated, player programmable, computer system based on a real historical
architecture. These computers drive the majority of the in-game systems and
award a huge amount of creative freedom to players by letting them program how
various aspects of their ships and other in-game equipment work. Ships are both
customizable and upgradeable and will be flown utilizing physics based orbital
mechanics. Players can engage in mining, scavenging, trading, crafting, combat,
and many other dedicated roles.
